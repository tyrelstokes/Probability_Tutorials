# Probability Tutorials
Probability tutorials Math 323. These are tutorials - questions and solutions I developed while TAing MATH 323 at McGill. Many of the questions come from or are adapted from materials originally prepared by Dave Stephens. The course follows wackerly Mathematical Statistics (ch. 2 - 7). Mistakes and typos are all mine. Places where there are less of those, credit to past students for pointing out where things didn't make sense.
